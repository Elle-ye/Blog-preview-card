## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm a bit more confident now with my positioning of the items than I was with the qr-code.
This also helped wake up some of the properties that were sleeping in my head. Case in point being the  object-fit property. Container queries as well.

### Continued development

I want to continue to focusing on my positioning, as well as container queries.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) - This helps a lot with understanding new concepts and usage. In this case, with understanding container queries better.
